# Car-Build_Tracker
Build your own PC concept website but with your car instead. See roadmap of executing car maintenance and overhauls.

Make a PC-Part-Picker website clone, but do it for cars instead of for PCs. See how far I can get, eventually going from the current builds from someone's setup to their ideal setup and what it would take to get there.

What is the simplest form of the idea? 
A user inputs the car they currently have.
Then inputs the modifications they want to do to the car.
The website spits out a timeline with actions and what is needed.
Go from there and develop more PC-Part-Picker features as time goes on.
